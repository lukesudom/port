# Port - my first web portfolio project!
Hi.

You can find my first web portfolio project here -  https://lukesudom.github.io/port/

Some of the contents include placeholders which i will add to as my work experience and projects increase. As you will note
they all link to my main githhub page which will be changed later.

One of the main challenges i faced which i will spend some more time on is understanding media sizing and how i can better set up my CSS for this.
I coded my CSS quite slopey i will admit and it could have definetely been done better which i will work on in future projects.

Overall i am quite happy with it!
